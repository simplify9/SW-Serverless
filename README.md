# SW.Serverless
*SW.Serverless* is a package that includes a library and functions made to allow users to write and deploy projects without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. 

## Getting Started with SW.Serverless
Once you have your program ready for installation it's all smooth sailing from there. 
1. Upload your program onto the [installer](https://github.com/simplify9/Serverless/blob/master/SW.Serverless.Installer/Program.cs), running it in your app using a key. 
2. Once your program is installed, allow the [runner](https://github.com/simplify9/Serverless/blob/master/SW.Serverless.Sdk/Runner.cs) to handle all the elbow-grease.
3. The user that previously handled the server that used *SW.Serverless* returns the data for you.
